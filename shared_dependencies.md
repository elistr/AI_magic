7. **Output.json**: This is the file where the scraped data will be stored in a structured format. It is used in "pipelines.py" and "reddit_scraper.py".

8. **Function Names**: Functions such as parse, start_requests, etc., defined in "reddit_spider.py" are used in "reddit_scraper.py" to control the flow of the scraping process.

9. **Scrapy Commands**: Commands like crawl, startproject, genspider, etc., are used in "reddit_scraper.py" to control the Scrapy spider and are part of the Scrapy library.
