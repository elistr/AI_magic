1. Scrapy: All the files in the project are dependent on the Scrapy library for Python. This library provides all the necessary tools and functions for web scraping.

2. RedditScraperItem: This is a data schema defined in "items.py" and is used in "pypl_spider.py" to structure the scraped data.

3. PyplSpider: This is the main spider class defined in "pypl_spider.py". It is used to perform the actual scraping of data from Reddit.

4. Settings: The "settings.py" file contains settings for the Scrapy project. These settings are used across all other files in the project.

5. Middlewares: The "middlewares.py" file contains middleware classes for the Scrapy project. These classes are used in the "settings.py" file and the "pypl_spider.py" file.

6. Pipelines: The "pipelines.py" file contains pipeline classes for the Scrapy project. These classes are used in the "settings.py" file and the "pypl_spider.py" file.

7. Scrapy.cfg: This is the configuration file for the Scrapy project. It is used by Scrapy to set up and initialize the project.

8. Reddit DOM elements: The "pypl_spider.py" file will need to reference specific DOM elements from Reddit to extract the required data. These might include elements like post titles, post content, post date, etc.

9. JSON: The scraped data is stored in a structured format in JSON. This format is used in the "pipelines.py" file to store the data.

10. Pagination and dynamic content handling: The "pypl_spider.py" file will need to handle pagination and dynamic content on Reddit. This involves shared functions and methods for navigating through pages and handling dynamic content.
